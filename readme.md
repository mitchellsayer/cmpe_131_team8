Intro

Our website is run from a local machine and can be accessed through any browser.
The website models a shop similar to amazon or Craigslist.
We were inspired by these successful websites to make an application that could be used in the real world.
This website is simple and user friendly in order to provide a different experience from our competitors.
The user will be able to search for listings, post their own listings, and checkout with items.
The website is structured with a home page to welcome our Users with news, featured listings, and updates.
From the home page users can reach a login page if they are not already logged in.
Once users are logged in the login button on the home page will be replaced with a user button where
users can change their settings or delete their account.
When logged in users gain access to post listings, look at their purchase history and so much more.
Users who are not logged in will only be able to navigate to the listings page where they may filter
or search listings and complete purchases.
We wrote this program in order to showcase our skills with linux, git, python, flask, and html/jinja.
