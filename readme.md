Title: Rojas Depot

Introduction: Welcome to Rojas Depot! Home to all of your online shopping needs. We are a team of Software and Computer Engineering students who wanted to design a reliable and user-friendly web application. What does this web application pertain to? We're glad you asked! For years, companies such as Home Depot, Walmart, Target, and Lowe's have made a profit promoting their goods through online shopping. We felt it in our best interests to capitalize on this trendy form of consumerism. Rojas Depot is home to a wide variety of products for our shoppers to choose from: food, clothing, toys, etc. At Rojas Depot, 100% customer satisfaction is our goal!

How to Install:
We used Python with Flask and SQLAlchemy. This was coupled with bootstrap, css, and html documents to make a webpage that can be downloaded from github and run using python3 run.py in a computer terminal that has python installed. Once Run in this way the website can be accessed from any web browser such as firefox or google chrome and typing "localhost:5000" into the address bar.

How to Use: Before the initial shopping commences, each visitor to our website must create an account. Each account contains an individual's email along with a password; pretty standard for all shopping services! Once our database has stored the new user's information, they are allowed to explore our products. If someone is a returning user, they are prompted to login with their credentials before being admitted. The first page everyone is directed to it the "Home" page. Here, our welcome message appears! At the top left corner of Rojas Depot, there is a list of tabs. Right next to the "Home" tab is our "Listings" tab. Here, users can see what items are currently offered at Rojas Depot. Only items which are in stock are shown to the user. Next to the "Listings" tab is the "New Listing" tab. As a bonus, each user who signs up with our website is allowed to sell their own merchandise. This helps broaden our reach to a wide array of customers! A user simply adds their item's image along with a "Quantity", "Price", and "Item Description". From there on, this item is displayed for other users to see. When it comes to purchasing, a user clicks on an item which interests them. Once they have selected the "Quantity" of the item, our website tabulates the total cost (including tax) to show the "Payment Due". We accept credit cards, debit cards, and PayPal as methods of payment. Once a customer's billing information has been entered, a confirmation email gets sent to them. On the right hand side of Rojas Depot's site is a few more tabs. First, we have the "Log Out" page. If a user is done accessing our website, they simply click on this tab to sign them out of the application. Next to this tab is by far our most accomodating feature, the "Profile" tab. Here, the users name is proudly displayed along with their profile picture. At Rojas Depot, we value the satisfication of our customers. But, if a user wishes to no longer be recognized by our databse, the "Profile" page has a "delete" button. 

List of Features: <br>
*User signup/login prompt, which requires ALL customers to be registered before accessing website <br>

Technologies Used: In order to have a robost sytem capable of storing multiple users, we relied on the tool SQLAlchemy. Because this application runs on Python, our classes and functions easily got converted into tables and SQL statements. To ensure our website was aethetically pleasing, we felt the need to implement Bootstrap. With such a wide array of templates, colors, and fonts, this allowed us to add creative flare to each web page. During the initial phases of our project, we relied on Ubuntu to implement our Python files. However, this strategy proved to be quite frustrating, especially when it came to pushing commits onto GitHub. Thus, we switched over to Visual Studios Code as our IDE. Utilizing this software made it quite easy to add, commit, push, and pull requests from each others coding elements. Visual Studios Code was used in conjunction with GitHub. This application made it easy for each team member to view changes made to our branches, files, etc. Overall, we had a solid setup that made it easier for each team member to contribute to this project.
